# üéØ Daily Coding Practice: LeetCode Solutions

This repository documents my systematic practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as part of my professional transition to a software development role. It serves as a verifiable record of my commitment to consistent problem-solving and algorithmic analysis.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by difficulty to clearly track progression and focus areas.

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Easy/` | Foundational problems focusing on mastering syntax, basic data structures (Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps), and core logic. |
| `Medium/` | Core algorithmic patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, BFS/DFS, Recursion, Simple Dynamic Programming). |
| `Hard/` | Advanced problems requiring optimized techniques, complex data structure manipulation, and deep algorithmic insight. |
| `template.py` | A standard template used to ensure **consistent documentation** and professional structure across all solutions. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Standards

Every solution file in this repository adheres to the following professional standards:

1.  **Standardized Naming:** Files are named using the format `[Problem Number]-[Problem Title].py` (e.g., `0001-Two-Sum.py`).
2.  **Complexity Analysis:** Each file includes metadata comments detailing the **Time Complexity ($O(n)$)** and **Space Complexity ($O(1)$)** of the implemented solution.
3.  **Local Testability:** All files include a runnable block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to demonstrate the function's output with example test cases.
